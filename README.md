## Creational Patterns
### Abstract Factory

> Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structural Patterns
### Adapter

> Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Behavioral Patterns
### Command

> Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.
